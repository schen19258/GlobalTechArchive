// 1. Create an array of bands/artists (strings) named coolBands. Be sure to use all lowercase letters.
// Not big music fans? Feel free to use the array supplied in your README!


// 2a. Use the prompt() function to get the user's favorite band and store it in a variable called userChoice.
// 2b. Convert the user's answer to lowercase.


// 3a. Check the coolBands array to see if it contains the user's answer.
// 3b. If the user's band is not in the array, alert "Never heard of them!"
// 3c. If the user's band is in the array, alert "OMG! I love them too!"
// Hint: You'll need to research the indexOf() method and find out what it returns if the argument you supply isn't found in the target array.


// ðŸ§  LevelUp:
// If the user's band is not in the array, alert "I'll have to check them out!" and add the band to the array. Then console.log the array to confirm that the new item is present.
