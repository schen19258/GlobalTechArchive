# Dark Mode Toggle
Today you'll be using JavaScript to add functionality to a page's dark mode toggle button. To accomplish this, you'll add logic the `toggleDarkMode` function provided in your `script.js` file. This function has already been connected to the dark mode button with an `onclick` attribute.

When a user clicks the dark mode button and `toggleDarkMode` is called, the `dark` class should toggle on and off of the HTML's `<body>` element. The text inside of the button should also change from "Dark Mode" to "Light Mode" based on which theme currently active. 

Another developer on your team has already written the CSS for both light and dark themes. All you have to do is write the JavaScript logic that will switch between the two!

We've left you some hints in `HINTS.md` in case you get stuck. Give it a try on your own first but, if you get stuck, feel free to take a peek!
